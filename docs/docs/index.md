- :fontawesome-solid-circle: Set software breakpoints

    ---
    - Set breakpoints on function entrance/exit, memory allocations, and in manual locations.
    - Conditional breakpoints `$cbreak`

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: C++ Documentation](macros.md#break)

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Debugger Documentation](commands.md)

- :fontawesome-solid-microchip: Inspect active threads


    ---
    - View active locks and which threads hold them
    - View the current callstack for a thread at any time
    - Easily switch the debuggers active context to another thread
