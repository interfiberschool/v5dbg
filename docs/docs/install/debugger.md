## Commons errors

??? danger "Waiting for user program execution on target to begin...."
    If you get **stuck** at this message it means we are still waiting for the **user program** to start on the brain.

    Make sure that:

    * You're **wired** to the brain over MicroUSB
    * You have **started** the user program on the brain

??? danger "Warning! DebugServer (local) has not gotten any OPEN messages from the debug server in over 5s, did the debug server freeze?"
    This means that the debug server running on the brain **hasn't** sent us any messages in over 5 seconds.

    This usually means:
    
    * The user program & debug server have **crashed**
    * The serial connection to the debug server has been **dropped**, try restarting the debugger
    * The user program is **hogging CPU resources** and not allowing the debug server to execute
